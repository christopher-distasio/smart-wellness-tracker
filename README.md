## License

*You don’t have to add a license to your Milestone 2 Project, but you can. It is a common part of a repo that specifies how the project can be used. Kinds of licenses allowing public use are very similar but have small differences that might matter for a specific project. The MIT or GNU general license are usually fine for a public repo.*

*This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details*


## Acknowledgments

 - *Citing someone else's code or resources used in the project*
 - *Inspiration*
 - *etc*


## Post-MVP Plans

- *Also called stretch goals*
- *One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.*
- *Another that will be a stretch.*
- *Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)*

*After you finish making/deploying your app, make sure to update and finalize the README.md file for the project, which should be in the top level of your files in the repo so that it's viewable right away when a user sees the "home page" of the repo. Of course, Github and your pinned projects are one of the most important ways for you to show potential employers your skill and professionalism. Make sure there are no glaring spelling errors (this is a great extension to spell check in VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).*


*## WHEN YOU'RE READY TO SUBMIT THE PROJECT, MAKE SURE TO REMOVE ALL TEXT IN ITALICS ABOVE AND ALL TEXT BELOW THIS POINT. NOTE: THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS BUILDING THE APP. ##*


## Project Planning

| Date | Goals |
| ---- | ----- |
| Sat. 2/3| Discuss project guidelines and resources; create repo and README.md for the project; teams and decide on a topic to be approved by the instructors then start working according to team git workflow process|
| Mon. 2/5| Meet in main room then hold standup meetings in breakout rooms; by break time after the first hour of class, all teams must have team members, tools and languages to use, someone assigned to be in charge of the project repo/s, and topic must be finalized; Work day in class; |    | Wed. 2/7 | Meet in main room then hold standup meetings in breakout rooms; Discuss deployment possibilities and begin preparation for it; Work day in class |
| Sat. 2/10 | Meet in main room then hold standup meetings in breakout rooms; Work day in class  |
| Mon. 2/12 | Meet in main room then hold standup meetings in breakout rooms; Your project should be deployed and all features contained in the app should work to satisfy all project requirements as shown on Canvas (or the same thing as a Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rayc4cBqavZ0XV7kgMiNLs0sBL44dgafEgaAQOMgfO0/edit?usp=sharing) The same requirements are also viewable and can be duplicated as a checklist here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XZd4I3_S_znzgsSt7oFbby6tMyHIQ6S4g6DaGCCimg/edit?usp=drivesdk |

## API Endpoints

It’s common for developers to show the various endpoints in their frontend and/or backend API/s as you would find in a third-party API provider. 

This resource shows examples of different ways you can show your endpoints: https://github.com/bufferapp/README/blob/master/billing/api-endpoints.md.


## Schema Diagram

*You should likely be using a tool (an app, pen and paper, etc.) to make an ERD (Entity Relational Diagram) if you’re using a relational database or a schema diagram if you’re using a document (NoSQL) database. You can usually use the same tool for diagramming for either kind, but here are some top choices:*

*ERD: Usually the RDMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) platform being used (PgAdmin, etc.) provides a feature to allow making diagrams from tables you’ve already made in the app.*

*How to Make an ERD Diagram in PgAdmin4.*

*Draw.io — A Common Choice for ERD Diagrams, Flowcharts, Wireframes*

*NoSQL DB Schema Modeling App: https://nosqldbm.ru/#/*


*ERD Diagram Example:*
